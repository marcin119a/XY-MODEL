# XY-MODEL
Monte Carlo simulation on 2D XY-model

Metropolis algorithm is applyed in the simulation.

Using this program, you can show the envolotion of 2D spin system at given temperature. 

Simulated Annealing is also applied to show the thermal observables versus temperature.

For more detail, see the comments in the .py file.
